 <div > <p><strong><a href="https://www.linkpskorea.com/">Preparing For Korean Plastic Surgery</a></strong></p>
    <p>
      Korea is becoming known as a place where people can come and
      get elective operations for affordable prices. When their own
      physicians at home are too busy or not available to carry out
      these procedures, people may choose to travel to this country
      to have operations carried out quickly and without a lot of
      expense. However, when you plan on traveling to Korea soon,
      you may wonder what you can do to prepare for <a href="https://www.linkpskorea.com/">Korean plastic surgery</a>. 
      Your overseas doctor may give you these instructions
      to ensure that you are ready for the procedure and that you
      are fully informed about what is about to take place in your
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Korean-Plastic-Surgery.jpg"
        ><img
          class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5"
          src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184609im_/http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Korean-Plastic-Surgery-300x300.jpg"
          alt="Korean Plastic Surgery"
          width="300"
          height="300" /></a
      >One of the first things you may be told to do involves making
      sure you are in good enough health for any operation. People
      who have underlying conditions like diabetes or high blood
      pressure might be unsuitable for such operations because they
      could risk complications like stroke, heart attacks, and
      death. You may be advised to check with your physician to
      ensure that you have none of these conditions or any others
      that could jeopardize your desired outcome. You might also
      take a letter or documentation with you to show that you are
      in good health.<a href="http://linkpsclinic.com" target="_blank">링크성형외과</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another tip that could come in handy involves making sure you
      are up to date on any required vaccinations. Many adults
      forget to update necessary immunizations like whooping cough
      and tetanus because these diseases are so rare today. However,
      when you travel somewhere for medical procedures, you may be
      exposed to illnesses that could make you sick before you might
      even checked into the medical facility. You can take your
      vaccination record to your doctor or to the local health
      department to ensure that all of your shots are current.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with making sure you are up to date on immunizations,
      you also may do well to stop taking any medications that could
      adversely affect your operation&#8217;s outcome. For example,
      if you are taking blood thinners, it could be advisable for
      you to stop taking them. Blood thinners would not allow your
      skin to heal or your blood to clot after the procedure.
      Likewise, you might fare well to halt the use of alcohol or
      recreational medications you may be taking as well. Your
      physician in the country may prefer that you are completely
      free of medications in case you need to be prescribed
      antibiotics or painkillers after your operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are prescribed any medicines, you will need a way to
      pay for them while you remain away from home. You also will
      need to pay for your actual hospital stay and your
      surgeons&#8217; fees. Some insurance companies will agree to
      pay for overseas procedures if they are required for your
      health. If they are elective, your insurer may refuse to pay.
      As such, it could help you to have plenty of money on hand or
      to use credit cards to cover these expenses. This precaution
      could help you avoid any legal complications that could arise
      from your inability to pay your medical bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also avoid complications with the outcome of your
      treatment if you are not overweight and in good shape. It
      might help you to lose weight prior to surgical intervention
      and to have a good heart rate and metabolism through
      exercising. Many patients begin working out a month or so
      prior to checking into the hospital. If you can work out and
      to lose weight, your efforts might be appreciated by your
      doctor and your surgical team. They can carry out the
      treatment without having to deal with your excess body weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your team also may appreciate it if you could bring legal
      documents with you in case of an emergency. Some of the
      documentation to have on hand might include a living will or
      written instructions for what needs to take place if you are
      incapacitated or you die during the operation. Your physician
      will need to know whom to contact and what relative to request
      information from if you are unable to answer questions. These
      papers can be kept in your hotel or checked in with the
      hospital&#8217;s registrar in more ideal cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, you may also notify your next of kin, if not your
      friends and coworkers, about your travels for this medical
      purpose. While modern medicine is very safe and effective, it
      does not come with a guarantee that every patient will do
      well. When you want to avoid any complications, you may be
      advised to notify your next of kin in case you perish or you
      need someone to speak on your behalf. This step might be
      legally required of you in some states. You can also retain a
      lawyer if you do not have any close family or friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      You likewise may fare well to ensure that your hotel and
      flights are booked and that you have plenty of time to rest
      and recuperate. Many hotels will give discounts if you plan on
      staying for long periods of time like a week or more. You also
      would do well to have your flights booked in advance. This
      step saves you from having to take care of these matters after
      you are discharged and perhaps are in a bit of pain from the
      treatment. You can already have a hotel room to return to and
      also have your tickets at the ready when you are able to
      travel back home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, with any medical procedure, you could be advised to
      know what to expect. It could pay you to do some research
      before signing paperwork. You might want to know how you will
      look and feel afterward. <a href="https://www.linkpskorea.com/">While plastic surgery done by Korean
      physicians can help you look and feel better</a>, you still may
      want to understand what will happen to you while you are
      asleep on the operating table. You also may want to know
      details like if you will have stitches, if you can take a
      shower after the procedure, or if you need to avoid drinking
      caffeine, smoking, or other habits during your recovery.

      >Calf Implants Have Become A Real Hot Topic As Of
      Late</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people seek out ways to improve the appearance of their
    bodies by means of cosmetic surgery; while the majority of
    them do this for themselves there are many that have
    procedures done because of medical conditions. Calf implants
    are becoming just as popular as breast augmentation or double
    eyelid surgeries. The calf is a part of the human body and is
    the rear portion of your lower leg, thus corresponding to the
    posterior section of your leg. This muscle has two parts and
    is attached to your heel through one&#8217;s Achilles tendon.
    This tendon is the thickest found in the human body and is
    also called the calcaneal tendon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having this procedure will create a much fuller look to the
    lower leg and is common in both men and women which are unable
    to achieve the tone of the muscle that they desire. Men more
    often try to emphasize the bulk of the muscle while woman
    generally only want to achieve anatomical balance. Many people
    will spend hours every day at the gym trying to tone but for
    some reason there are a few that are unable to achieve
    sculptured legs and their only means is to have implants done.
    On the medical side it is done to improve balance as well as
    to correct congenital defects. These can be chicken legs,
    clubfoot and bowleggedness.
  </p>

        src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184609im_/http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Calf-Implants-280x300.jpg"

        height="300" /></a
    >It is more commonly used with bodybuilders as many have
    trouble building certain muscles. Those with a high insertion
    tend to find it difficult to build calf mass as there is a
    lack of striated muscles in that area. Those that have a low
    insertion generally tend to be able to achieve a larger mass
    but seem to lack muscle definition. This operation can be very
    effective for both of these scenarios and have excellent
    outcome.
  </p>
  <p>
    The surgeon who is to perform this procedure needs to be
    highly skilled as he will need to be able to determine the
    correct size and shape so that the proportions look correct.
    The best candidates are those that have good health and are in
    good physical condition. An implant of soft but solid silicone
    is positioned over the gastrocnemuis muscle. This is the first
    of the main calf muscles and the second is the soleus muscle.
    They both run the full length of the lower leg and are
    connected to a third muscle, the plantaris just behind the
    knee as well as the heel.
  </p>
  <p>
    The gastrocnemuis muscle is referred to as having two heads,
    the first is on the upper and inside of the leg and the other
    is also on the upper but on the outside of the leg. It is
    attached to the back of the leg on either side of the femoral
    bone. The silicone implants are inserted in incisions that are
    made behind the knee creases and the person can opt for only
    the inner head, outer head or for both. Before the operation
    begins the legs are measured so that the correct size of the
    implants can be ordered.
  </p>
  <p>
    The patient will be put under general anaesthesia and will be
    laid on their stomach for easier access. A special instrument
    will be used to create a pocket just big enough for the
    implant to fit securely inside. Bleeding is normally minimal
    and before closing up the incision the leg will be examined
    carefully to ensure that the effect is correct. The cut in the
    fascia muscle is then closed and the patient will be taken to
    recovery.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    The first week of recovery is referred to as the surgical part
    and the patient will be asked to walk around but when sitting
    or lying down the leg will need to be kept up so as to prevent
    swelling. The first day after the procedure is done the
    patient will be encouraged to get up and move to the bathrooms
    but only with assistance. The second day the dressings will be
    removed and one will then are told to increase their
    activities as this will help the muscles to become use to
    having implants. The more exercise that is done the more the
    legs will begin to stretch and the feeling of limitation will
    decrease.
  </p>
  <p>
    The long term recovery phase is generally when the person
    begins to walk comfortably even if they are a bit stiff to
    begin with at about three weeks after the procedure. Slight
    bruising has been known to happen but will soon disappear. A
    cream will be issued upon discharge that must be used as
    prescribed as it will lessen scarring. It is recommended that
    any bicycling or running be kept out of the exercise routine
    for at least one to two months but it can vary from person to
    person. It can take as long as six weeks for the average
    person to begin their full routine again. As with any
    procedure there are risks of complications and some of them
    can be infections, bleeding as well as nerve or muscle damage.
    In more serious cases there could be slippage of the implants
    resulting in lop-sidedness.
  </p>

    It is a rare occurrence that babies are born with
    Poliomyelitis which is a viral infection disease and normally
    causes total paralysis. In most of the cases the lower legs
    are affected and many are able to have an implant which does
    help with their balance as well as look. This disease is
    affecting less and less people thanks to the vaccine and this
    injection will protect one for the rest of their lives. Club
    foot is another birth defect and occurs in the ankle and foot
    areas. There are some cases that this condition has affected
    the development and growth of the calf muscle, leaving one
    muscle smaller than the other. An operation of this kind will
    help with the ordinary anatomical balance of the legs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The price of this procedure will vary. In Los Angeles and
    Beverly Hills it could cost about six thousand five hundred to
    seven thousand five hundred dollars and only includes the
    surgeon&#8217;s fees. In Canada however they charge about nine
    thousand dollars excluding tax but include everything from the
    surgical fees, hospital fees as well as the implants, nurses
    and doctors involved in the procedure.

      >Critical Points To Note About Breast Enlargement
      Surgery</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    The decision to go through cosmetic surgery is an important
    turning point for many people. Cosmetic surgery helps in
    enhancing parts of the body that do not feel exactly as they
    should. Breast enlargement surgery is done to create
    better-looking breasts which help in boosting self-confidence.
    It assists in altering the shape, position, size or firmness
    of the breasts and generally achieve a curvier figure. One
    should get clear and accurate information to assist in
    decision-making about this important procedure.

    >For safe and quality outcome, visit a reputable clinic where
    you can discuss important details before the actual operation.
    A good practitioner will want to go over your current health
    status to determine if there are conditions that call for
    extra care. A look at your medical history is also necessary
    to help determine how best to proceed. Some medical
    conditions, pregnancy, and certain medications are not
    conducive to the procedure. Talks are also likely to go over
    the desired size, shape and other crucial details. The
    clinical advisor should answer your questions satisfactorily
    before and after the procedure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quality follow-up is necessary to ensure every stage is
    planned as expected. Respected professionals have to make
    plans for the procedure to ensure the patient is ready and
    knowledgeable about what is going on. Consultative talks start
    way before the actual procedure is carried out. Discussions
    between the medical professionals and the patient are held
    before the procedure to determine what is needed. The patient
    gives an idea of what the outcome should be while the surgeon
    listens and plans the way forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    A surgeon can then evaluate the needs of the client and advice
    accordingly. If the client&#8217;s wishes are not realistic
    enough, the surgeon ought to share those views and offer
    workable alternatives. By going over what is right for a
    particular situation, a patient has a better chance of
    achieving the desired results.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dialog is not only necessary before the big day, but is also
    crucial at all stages of the procedure. This is where a
    surgeon can get hints of an operation that is not going right,
    or where something is missing or being misinterpreted.
    Patients may sometimes develop strange characteristics when
    undergoing surgical procedures. Professionals can then come
    together and formulate a workable solution to such problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    A successful procedure is a result of many processes that have
    to go well for the objectives to be reached. For instance, a
    small incision is made at the right place where it is less
    viewable. This way, scarring is minimized and when the wound
    heals, the small scar will not be easy to detect. Being less
    intrusive is also effective for reducing pain and shortening
    the healing process than it would if the wound was large. Such
    precision requires a qualified professional to handle it well.
  </p>
  <p>
    The importance of proper quality and safe treatment cannot be
    overstated. Safety ought to be at the center of each
    operation. To avoid infection, doctors take care to prevent
    unnecessary contact between the implant and other objects.
    This includes gloves and even the patient&#8217;s skin. That
    way, the implant remains sterile and safe for use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most surgical procedures on the breasts take minimal time. It
    is not uncommon for one to take an hour from the beginning to
    the end. After the surgical procedure, one has to stay a
    little longer in the medical facility, possibly overnight, for
    monitoring purposes. This is to enable the surgeons and other
    professionals to check on the results and healing process. If
    there is any problem or something is out of the ordinary, it
    becomes easier to find out early enough and deal with it
    quickly and effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    Under normal circumstances, you will be free to go home the
    next day. Some of your normal duties will be interrupted since
    you will be required to rest for about a week, So, you may
    have to make alternative plans if there are household chores
    or other work that you have to do. For best results, you will
    have to wear a special supportive bra all the time. It
    supports the breasts in a comfortable position where they do
    not get strained in any way. Doing so provides the right
    environment for fast healing.
  </p>
  <p>

    >Full recovery often takes four to six weeks. By then the
    scars will have healed and you will be able to enjoy other
    activities without worrying about your body. Some people get
    back to normal life sooner than others. A week is often enough
    for one to get comfortable and possibly go back to work.
    However, ensure that your work does not involve strenuous
    activities that will put you at risk of not healing properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may be wondering whether breast implants will affect
    normal life or prevent you from doing certain things.
    Normally, your life will not be affected in any way. You can
    breastfeed as usual and just go on with your life just as
    before. It may be necessary to point some things out to the
    surgeon before the operation for consideration. For instance,
    breastfeeding may call for a different way of creating the
    incision. That way, a baby can feed without any hindrance or
    causing discomfort to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    If by any chance there is discomfort around the breast area,
    you need to see your doctor to establish the cause. In rare
    cases, the body tissue can grow around the implant and harden
    thereby squeezing the implant. This condition is called
    contraction. If it happens, you may experience slight
    discomfort and possibly reddish blemishes on the skin covering
    the area. The doctor will be able to check on that and advise
    on what is to be done to remedy the situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Making a decision to enhance the look of your body is often a
    major step in life. By creating the desired looks, you get to
    attain the results you want, boost self-confidence and improve
    the general outlook on life. It is important to partner with
    the right professionals to ensure the outcome you desire is
    attained. Quality providers not only work with you before and
    during the procedure, but they are also there to guide and
    monitor your progress afterward.

      >How To Know If Silicone Breast Implants Are Right For
      You</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Breast reconstructive surgery is an elective procedure that
    rebuilds the tissue in women who have had all or a portion of
    one or both breasts removed. Augmentation surgery is an
    elective cosmetic procedure for women who wish to have bigger
    breasts. Both procedures may involve inserting silicone breast
    implants to reconstruct or change the contour of the breasts.
  </p>
  <p>
    One decision women undergoing this procedure must make is
    whether to have a saline implant or a silicone implant. All
    breast implants have an outer shell made of silicone. The
    products made to be filled saline are inserted into the
    woman&#8217;s body empty. After they are placed in the chest
    cavity, the surgeon fills them with a predetermined amount of
    sterile salt water.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a
      href="http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Silicone-Breast-Implants.jpg"
      ><img
        class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-140"
        src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184609im_/http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Silicone-Breast-Implants-300x200.jpg"
        alt="Silicone Breast Implants"
        width="300"
        height="200" /></a
    >Silicone implants come already filled with a viscous, sticky
    fluid called silicone gel. Many women opt for this type of
    implant because they believe the material feels and looks more
    natural than a saline implant. Both types are considered safe
    for breast reconstruction and augmentation. A patient and her
    physician should discuss both options to decide the best
    course based on the patient&#8217;s health status, anatomy,
    and personal preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both implant types pose similar health risks following the
    procedure. Capsular contracture is a condition where scar
    tissue develops and distorts the shape of the breast. Some
    patients experience a temporary change in sensation in the
    breast or nipple but this usually goes away on its own.
    Additional risks include infection and pain. Complications
    could require additional surgical procedures for removal or
    replacement of one or both implants.
  </p>
  <p>
    One thing many women worry about is liquid escaping into the
    body due to a rupture or leakage. When a saline implant
    bursts, the liquid leaks into the body and the implant
    deflates changing the shape and size of the breast. The body
    naturally absorbs the saline. The saline is harmless to health
    but surgery is often necessary to remove the implant shell or
    replace it with a new one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The body does not absorb silicone and in most cases, the
    substances remains trapped inside the capsule that forms to
    surround the implant. Some women are unaware they have a
    rupture, which is why physicians refer to it as a silent
    rupture. Sometimes the woman will notice a change in breast
    shape or localized pain. Ruptures are often detected with an
    MRI scan. If the patient does not have any symptoms, the
    doctor may recommend leaving the implant in place, removing
    it, or replacing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Women considering these surgeries for cosmetic reasons should
    review expectations and outcomes with their personal
    physician. Inserting an implant will not prevent sagging. The
    only way to correct this problem is to have a lift in addition
    to augmentation. An implant is not guaranteed to last a
    lifetime. As many as two out of eight women must have them
    removed within eight to 10 years due to a rupture. Weight
    fluctuations can change the way the breasts look after the
    surgery making it necessary to undergo additional procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Women who plan to have a baby following augmentation or
    reconstruction must consider the effect on their ability to
    breast feed. Some women can successfully breastfeed a child.
    Others are not able to breastfeed and must rely on
    bottle-feeding while the child is an infant.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some health considerations to factor in as well. The
    FDA recommends women with silicone implants schedule an MRI
    scan every two years. This regular monitoring should begin
    three years after the implant procedure. Routine mammograms
    are recommended as they are with all women but additional
    views are necessary to scan a breast with an implant.
  </p>
  <p>
    The breast may continue to develop until a woman reaches her
    early 20s. Women seeking augmentation for cosmetic purposes
    must be at least 18 years old to receive a saline-filled
    implant. The minimum age is 22 for women who opt for a
    silicone implant.
  </p>
  <p>
    The implant procedure may take place in a hospital with an
    overnight stay or on an outpatient basis in a local surgical
    clinic. Most patients receive general anesthesia, which puts
    them to sleep during the surgery. The procedure may take up to
    two hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a

        alt="silicone breast implants cost"
        width="300"
        height="217" /></a
    >Depending on the type of implant and the patient&#8217;s
    anatomical features, the surgeon makes an incision around the
    nipple, under the arm, or under the breast. The implant rests
    in a pocket either below or above the chest muscle. The
    surgeon seals the incision with surgical tape or sutures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reconstruction involves a more complicated procedure than
    augmentation. Woman who opt for an implant following a
    mastectomy may require the insertion of a tissue expander to
    create a pocket for the implant. Flap reconstruction requires
    the transfer of skin, fat, or muscle from another part of the
    body to create the breasts. This produces a natural feel and
    look but the recovery period is longer than with implants.
    Nipple reconstruction involves skin grafting and tattooing to
    reconstruct the nipple after reconstructing the breast.
  </p>
  <p>
    After the surgery, the breasts are covered with gauze to
    protect the incision sites against infection. Some patients
    require the insertion of drainage tubes. The surgeon will
    schedule a follow up visit to remove the tubes after a few
    days. Patients are advised against heavy lifting for
    approximately six weeks to allow the surgical site to heal.
    Swelling around the breasts is normal but will subside with
    time. Patients may take over-the-counter or prescription
    medications to manage pain during the recovery process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Breast reconstruction or augmentation improves self-image,
    especially in women who undergo a mastectomy to treat cancer.
    An implant can also improve symmetry, increase fullness, and
    restore volume lost after pregnancy or extreme weight loss.
    Patients should weigh their options when choosing between
    saline and silicone. Consultation with an experienced cosmetic
    surgeon is necessary to review the risks and success rates for
    each type of surgery. Experts recommend choosing a surgeon
    with a minimum of five years of surgical training and a
    minimum of two years performing plastic surgery. Implant
    procedures may be covered by insurance depending on the
    patient&#8217;s circumstances and policy.

  <p><strong>What To Expect From Facelift Surgery</strong></p>
  <p>
    Everyone wishes to look younger. The natural aging process
    takes its slow but sure toll on the skin and adds telltale
    wrinkles, especially around the eyes and mouth. While science
    has yet to find a way to stop the effects of aging, people do
    have plenty of options when it comes to slowing down or
    disguising those effects. Additional factors that cause the
    face to lose its youthful shape include gravity, stress,
    environmental conditions, and genetics. Facelift surgery is
    among the most popular procedures when it comes to eliminating
    unwanted wrinkles and taking years off a person&#8217;s
    appearance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The medical term for a facelift is a rhytidectomy. This
    surgical procedure can eliminate sagging and soften the deep
    creases between the corners of the mouth and the nose.
    Additional goals may include eliminating the jowls created
    when skin in the lower face loses its tone, removing excess
    fat and skin under the jaw and chin, and eliminating creases
    underneath the lower eyelids.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a
      href="http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Facelift-Surgery.jpg"
      ><img

        alt="Facelift Surgery"
        width="222"
        height="300" /></a
    >Patients must have realistic expectations and realize what a
    facelift can and cannot accomplish. Facelifts do not stop the
    aging process in its tracks and they do not change the
    fundamental appearance of the people who have them. In some
    cases, this surgery may be combined with one or more other
    procedures including brow lifts, neck lifts, and eyelid
    surgeries to achieve the best results.
  </p>
  <p>
    Surgeons can reconfigure certain parts of the face and
    reposition contours, but facelifts will not improve the
    quality and texture of facial skin. If the skin has extreme
    sun damage, a resurfacing procedure may result in a smoother
    surface. This procedure will not eliminate irregular skin
    color or erase creases adjacent to the upper lip and nose.
  </p>
  <p>
    The initial consultation allows the cosmetic surgeon to take
    the patient&#8217;s full medical history and ask about any
    ongoing medical treatments, drug allergies, and current use of
    vitamins, supplements, tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs. The
    surgeon will perform a complete physical examination to assess
    health status and any possible risk factors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The surgeon will discuss all facelift options with the patient
    and review all possible complications and side effects. This
    allows the patient to make an informed decision about the
    procedure. The initial meeting includes a close visual
    examination of the face. The surgeon will take photographs and
    measure various portions of the face. Surgeons recommend the
    best action but always take into account the patient&#8217;s
    preferences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Patients should consider all possible risks and negative side
    effects before agreeing to surgery. Side effects range from
    minor to severe although the most serious side effects are
    rare. A facelift leaves permanent scars on the face but they
    are minor and are usually hidden by facial contours and the
    hairline. Some patients with short hair allow it to grow
    before the procedure to conceal incisions during the healing
    process. Rarely, the scars are raised and red. When this
    happens the physician can inject a corticosteroid to reduce
    the appearance of the scars.
  </p>
  <p>
    All patients can expect a certain amount of bruising and
    swelling during the recovery process. Facial movements may
    feel stiff because the swelling will distort facial features
    for several weeks after the procedure. Applying cold
    compresses while keeping the head elevated can provide some
    relief. The process of repositioning tissue in the neck and
    face can affect the nerves. Some patients will feel numbness
    in the neck, scalp, or cheek for up to two years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hair loss around the incision is a common side effect with
    facelifts. For some patients, the hair loss is a temporary
    condition that goes away within a couple months. Some patients
    experience permanent hair loss. The solution for this problem
    is to remove the area of hairless skin or transplant a portion
    of the scalp to the affected area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rare side effects include skin loss and facial nerve
    paralysis. The skin may slough off if the procedure cuts off
    the circulation to the face. Smokers are at a higher risk for
    skin sloughing off after a facelift. Damaged facial nerves can
    cause permanent or temporary muscle weakness. If the damage is
    temporary, sensation will usually return within 12 months.
  </p>
  <p>
    A facelift carries the same risks as any other major surgery.
    These include infection at the incision site and bleeding.
    Anesthesia can cause an adverse reaction in certain
    individuals. The surgeon should discuss all risks with the
    patient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some patients are not good candidates for this procedure.
    Anyone who is taking blood thinners or who has a medical
    condition that causes abnormal bleeding should not have a
    facelift. Anyone with uncontrolled high blood pressure or
    diabetes may face problems during recovery and should proceed
    with caution. Smokers should quit before surgery and avoid
    smoking during recovery to reduce the risk of skin loss.
  </p>

        alt="facelift surgery cost"

    >The surgeon may perform the procedure in an outpatient
    surgical clinic or in a regular hospital. Some patients will
    require a local anesthetic plus sedation while others will be
    unconscious under general anesthesia. The surgeon will choose
    the method of anesthesia and the surgical technique used based
    on the patient&#8217;s individual needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    A traditional facelift involves a series of incisions along
    the hairline, in front of the ears, and down to the lower
    scalp. In some cases, the surgeon makes an incision under the
    chin for access to tissues in the neck. A limited incision
    procedure involves incisions starting at the temples and
    continuing down in front of the patient&#8217;s ears.
    Sometimes incisions are necessary under the upper lip and in
    the lower eyelids. To perform a neck lift, the surgeon makes
    an incision underneath the chin and several more starting at
    the earlobes and running behind the ears to the lower scalp.
  </p>
  <p>
    The surgeon removes excess fat from the neck, jowls, and face
    before redistributing tissue. Sometimes fat from another area
    is added to the face. The surgeon removes any excess skin and
    closes the incisions with tape or stitches.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of any cosmetic surgery is to improve appearance.
    This has a positive effect on self-esteem and boosts
    self-confidence. Patients with realistic expectations and a
    positive attitude toward the procedure and recovery time can
    expect the best outcomes.

      >Everything That You Need To Know About Facial Plastic
      Surgery</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    There are a number of innovative solutions that people can use
    when seeking cosmetic improvements. This is true whether or
    not they have sustained disfiguring injuries, want to change
    features that they were born with including congenital defects
    or simply want to defy the signs of aging. Learning more about
    your options in facial plastic surgery could help you discover
    a treatment that will build your confidence, establish facial
    balance and positively impact the way that others perceive
    you.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is first important to note that there is a very broad range
    of procedures that can be performed. People with a broad range
    of problems can use multiple procedures to obtain the looks
    that they really want. Smaller and less invasive options can
    also be use to affect a more modest amount of change. Thus,
    people are virtually guaranteed to find options that are best
    in line with their own goals and needs.

    >Facelifts are commonly used to tighten sagging facial skin
    and give people the appearance of youth and vitality. These
    work best for people who are not able to achieve desirable
    results from other, more moderate aesthetic treatments such as
    the use of injectible toxins. During these procedures, small
    incisions are made at the outer edges of the face which are
    often concealed by the hairline or jawline. Excess skin is
    trimmed and the entire visage is pulled tighter and sutured in
    place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Blepharoplasty or eyelid surgery is often performed to correct
    cosmetic issues but it can also have practical applications as
    well. People can have these treatments performed to create
    double-eyelids, wider-looking eyes and overall facial balance.
    They are relatively non-invasive and are usually completed as
    outpatient procedures. They can be very effective for removing
    under-eye bags and for correcting low-hanging brows.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the vision is obstructed by a low-hanging brow or excess
    facial skin, any related surgeries could be covered by the
    patient&#8217;s health insurance plan, rather than being paid
    for out of pocket. This is often the case when the
    patient&#8217;s ophthalmologist and surgeon agree that the
    excess skin is compromising his or her ability to see clearly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rhinoplasty or nose jobs are used to correct structural issues
    pertaining to the nose. They can be used to refine the tip of
    the nose, reshape the nostrils or open up the nasal passages
    for improved nasal breathing and overall functionality.
    Surgeries like these are often necessary for establishing
    facial balance and for improving night breathing among other
    things. They can be both cosmetic and medically necessary for
    ensuring an optimal life quality and good health.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chin and cheek implants are commonly used in people who are
    seeking more facial volume. These can radically alter the
    structure of a patient&#8217;s face to create a desired look
    or to reduce wrinkles without cutting or pulling. They are
    often recommended for use in conjunction with other procedures
    in order to promote balance among all facial structures and a
    more aesthetically appealing appearance overall.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also a number of relatively non-invasive procedures
    that are used to turn back the proverbial hands of time
    without cutting. For instance, some providers are also using
    dermal fillers to create a more youthful appearance in their
    patients. These are placed under the skin in order to add
    volume in areas that have begun to sag. They entail very
    nominal recovery times and can provide immediate improvements
    in the appearance of the face.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consulting with a reputable and experienced plastic surgeon is
    the first step in determining which procedures are best for
    you. Your provider can talk to you about your cosmetic issues
    and help you establish feasible goals for this process. He or
    she can also show you before an after images of people who
    have undergone similar transitions so that you can established
    and informed opinion before making any decisions about your
    future treatments. The goal of these professionals is to help
    people make choices that will have the best short and
    long-term benefits.

    >There are many instances in which surgeons may recommend
    multiple procedures in order to give the face a cohesive and
    well-designed appearance. If one feature is radically altered,
    this can have a significant impact on the balance and symmetry
    of other features. For instance, after having blepharoplasty
    performed to open up the eyelids, many people may discover
    that the tips of their noses are too wide or large to properly
    complement the new appearance of their eyes. Getting a brow
    lift or chin implants installed could create the aesthetic
    need for cheek implants, lip implants or even rhinoplasty for
    creating impressive results.
  </p>
  <p>
    Candidacy for these procedures is determined by a number of
    key factors. It is usually important for people to be in good
    general health. Many providers also prefer that their clients
    not smoke. The use of tobacco products can have a significant
    impact on the body&#8217;s own, natural healing abilities.
    Having reasonable expectation for the results of these
    procedures is key as well. Before any procedure is scheduled,
    surgeons will complete comprehensive medical examinations and
    learn more about patient histories. Clotting issues and
    problems with excess bleeding could disqualify people as
    candidates given that these things will have a significant
    impact on treatment risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important for prospective patients to have a
    comprehensive understanding of the requirements for before and
    after care. Recovery times and needs can vary widely depending
    upon the types of surgeries received, the magnitude of these
    procedures, the severity of the issues being addressed and the
    patient&#8217;s overall goals for aesthetic improvements. In
    most instances, patients are advised to discontinue use of
    tobacco products and any medications that negatively impact
    their clotting abilities, several weeks before their
    treatments are performed. After most invasive surgeries, some
    inflammation, swelling discomfort and mild bruising will
    occur. These are issues that will naturally abate as healing
    progresses and with proper aftercare. Surgeons will advise
    their patients on self-care following their treatments,
    including on the use of compression garments, antibiotics for
    preventing infection and other essential steps for ensuring
    good health and optimal benefits.

  <p><strong>All About Getting A Korean Nose Job</strong></p>
  <p>
    These days, rhinoplasty is so common that almost anyone who
    has the money can be able to get it. One of the most famous
    places to get a rhinoplasty or simply a nose job would of
    course be Korea as this place has some of the most advanced
    methods in plastic surgery in the entire world. Getting a
    korean nose job is extremely easy here and the results are
    definitely fantastic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now before getting a rhinoplasty in Korea, it is very
    important for one to know all about this type of procedure.
    One will definitely look like one of those famous korean movie
    stars after the procedure but it does take time before that
    happens. So before one would go into this type of thing, it is
    best to study first about it and know a little bit about this
    type of surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now one thing to remember is that this kind of plastic surgery
    is not just for women as men may also get it as well. Korean
    men are especially very fond of rhinoplasty as their usually
    flat noses may become sharp after this type of procedure. Of
    course both the male and the females may have different
    techniques used based on their facial structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a
      href="http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Korean-Nose-Job.jpg"
      ><img

        alt="Korean Nose Job"
        width="300"
        height="224" /></a
    >Before one would want to go for this type of procedure, the
    least that should be known would be the areas that will be
    covered in the face. In order to get a well shaped nose, the
    forehead also must be done as the forehead is directly
    connected to the intended area. As it is aligned with the
    forehead, the forehead has to be lifted up a little bit for
    nose to become slightly sharper.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from the forehead area, the chin as well as the lips
    have to be fixed as well. In order to support the intended
    part to be lifted, the structure of the mouth area must also
    be done as well. As one can see, the entire face parts are all
    connected with each other which means that if one would
    change, then the entire facial structure would have to change
    as well. This is the holistic principle that the practitioners
    in Korea believe in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now usually, there would be two types of material that can be
    used in order to fix this area. These two would be the Gore
    Tex and the other would of course be the Silicone. Both of
    them are quite safe but both do have their own pros and cons
    if one would decide to use either one of them for his or her
    surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now in a nutshell, the Gore Tex is a softer material than
    Silicone so this one is great for those who would have thinner
    or more sensitive skin. The Silicone material would be better
    for those who would have tougher or thicker skin as the skin
    would be able to take the hardness of the Silicone. So before
    choosing which one of these materials will be used, one has to
    know the effects each of these materials would do to his or
    her skin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now if one would want to do revision surgery, then probably
    the best type of material that should be used would be the
    Silicone as this is the easiest to take out. Gore Tex may also
    be good however, Gore Tex would most likely be stuck to the
    skin already and may have a harder time being taken out. So if
    one is still going to go for revision surgery or a second
    procedure, then it is best that he or she would use Silicone.
    However, if one does not plan to go for revision procedures
    anymore, then the Silicone one will do just fine.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a
      href="http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/korean-nose-job-before-and-after.jpg"
      ><img
        class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-128"
        src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184609im_/http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/korean-nose-job-before-and-after-300x190.jpg"
        alt="korean nose job before and after"
        width="300"
        height="190" /></a
    >The use of the material would also depend on the gender of
    the person. Since the skin of a man is naturally tougher than
    that of a woman, then Silicone would most likely be the one
    that will be used on the men. The Gore Tex would most likely
    be used more on the women since women are known to have
    thinner and more sensitive skin. Of course which of these will
    be used will all depend on the skin type of the person. It is
    for this very reason that a lot of consultations have to be
    made before the actual procedure is done. This is to make sure
    that the accurate type of treatment is done so that the
    patient will be safe and satisfied with his or her results.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once one has already undergone the surgery, then he or she
    should expect some changes within three months. Now while this
    is happening, he or she has to constantly take care of the
    nose area meanwhile because if one does not, then the material
    attached to it may come off. So right after the surgery, one
    should expect a little bit of pain and should expect to be
    very careful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now the great thing about doing this type of plastic surgery
    in Korea is that it is extremely safe. They are known to have
    some of the most advanced equipment that can be found in the
    entire world. They are also known to have some of the best
    doctors as well. So combine their superb facilities and their
    well trained doctors, then one will definitely be able to see
    great results. In fact, even the stars of the shows would
    undergo major transformations in order to look good. That is
    how well versed the doctors in Korea are when it comes to
    rhinoplasty procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery
    procedures in the entire world. Nowadays people flock to Korea
    just to get one because of the whole Korean fad. A lot of
    people want to look like one of those Korean stars that can be
    seen on television. Well it is definitely no surprise since
    the stars that can be seen on television are very good looking
    and it is definitely possible to get their looks by some
    surgery.

  <p><strong>Get The Facts About Ear Cosmetic Surgery</strong></p>
  <p>
    Otoplasty is the medical term for a variety of cosmetic
    surgical procedures used to correct abnormal features of the
    ears, including protruding or misshapen ears. Surgeons most
    often perform ear cosmetic surgery on children between the
    ages of 4 and 14 but some people decide to have these
    procedures later in life as adults. Otoplasty is effective for
    correcting protruding ears, abnormally large lobes, tips that
    fold down, and conditions that result in the absence of
    certain features of normal ears.
  </p>
  <p>
    An Indian physician first introduced this type of
    reconstructive procedure during the 5th century BC. At that
    time, the technique was used to help people who were punished
    for criminal, military, and religious reasons with amputation
    of body parts, including the ears. A German physician
    practicing during the 19th century was the first to report on
    a technique for correcting prominent ears.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a
      href="http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ear-Cosmetic-Surgery.jpg"
      ><img
        class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-123"
        src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184609im_/http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ear-Cosmetic-Surgery-300x187.jpg"
        alt="Ear Cosmetic Surgery"
        width="300"
        height="187" /></a
    >The external portion of the ear is called the pinna. The
    pinna is made of cartilage and forms a complex framework
    covered with hairless skin. This structure is attached to the
    head by the shank, which extends outward from the auditory
    canal, or external auditory meatus.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plastic surgeons perform three main types of otoplasty for
    patients depending on the type of defect. Physicians trained
    in otoplasty have the skills necessary to correct certain
    deformities or defects. The three main types of procedures are
    pinback, reduction, and augmentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pinback, sometimes referred to as pinning, is the most common
    surgery. This procedure is used to correct protruding ears. By
    decreasing the angle of protrusion, the surgeon can improve
    facial symmetry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Patients may undergo pinning surgery in a surgeon&#8217;s
    office, a hospital, or an outpatient clinic. The physician may
    use local or general anesthesia depending on the
    patient&#8217;s specific situation. The basic procedure
    requires small incisions on the back of the ears where they
    attach to the head. After trimming or removing excess skin or
    cartilage, the surgeon repositions the ears and secures them
    in place with internal stitches, which are permanent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pnning requires small incisions on the outer ears. The surgeon
    repositions the bowls of the ears so they are closer to the
    head. In some cases, the surgeon removes excess cartilage to
    allow the ears to lay flat against the head.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some patients have ears with the proper structure and shape
    but they are too big for the face and head. The medical term
    for this condition is macrotia. Surgeons can help these
    patients with ear reduction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Earlobe reduction, or lobe-plasty, is often done to improve
    appearance in older adults. With age, the earlobes can
    elongate and become floppy. Lobe-plasty puts the lobes back in
    proportion to the size of the patient&#8217;s ears. This
    offers a subtle but effective improvement in the
    patient&#8217;s appearance. Although it can be performed as a
    standalone procedure, many patients will have this procedure
    in conjunction with a facelift.
  </p>
  <p>
    Augmentation is a reconstructive procedure that helps patients
    with missing or underdeveloped portions of their outer ears or
    lobes. Augmentation can expand and enlarge these features. The
    surgeon will often harvest cartilage from some other place on
    the body to create ears that look natural.
  </p>
  <p>
    Physicians will usually not consider performing procedures on
    children under the age of 5. This is because the cartilage in
    the affected area is not yet stable. Good candidates for these
    procedures are at least 6 years old and do not object to
    having surgery when discussing the procedure. They must be in
    good health and without untreated infections or
    life-threatening diseases.
  </p>
  <p>
    When screening teenagers and adults, physicians look for
    patients who have specific goals for the surgery and a
    positive attitude about the procedure. Patients should be
    non-smokers in good health. They must not have any illness
    that impairs hearing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adult patients usually receive a local anesthetic and a
    sedative to induce relaxation during the procedure. Children
    are more likely to undergo these procedures under a general
    anesthesia. This puts them to sleep during the surgery to
    ensure they do not move. Adults can usually go home following
    the surgery. Most physicians prefer children stay overnight in
    a hospital for observation.
  </p>
  <p>

        alt="ear cosmetic surgery before and after"
        width="300"
        height="135" /></a
    >Recovery usually takes approximately one week. Patients,
    regardless of age, are advised to stay home for at least seven
    days to allow time for the ears to heal. The patient&#8217;s
    head is bandaged and the physician will let the patient know
    how long to keep the bandage in place and how to manage it
    while sleeping. The bandage is usually removed after three
    days. The physician will replace it with a dressing shaped
    like a headband. Some patients will need to wear the dressing
    for as long as three weeks. If the surgery requires temporary
    stitches, the surgeon will remove them approximately one week
    after the procedure. Most of these procedures will leave small
    scars but they are barely perceptible and the patient can
    expect them to fade over time. It is important to protect the
    surgical area from excessive motion, abrasions, and excessive
    force during the healing process. The physician will advise
    the patient on how to take the proper precautions during
    recovery.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adult patients or parents of children undergoing these
    procedures must weigh the possible risks against the benefits.
    Any type of surgery carries a certain risk of complications,
    especially those done under general anesthesia. With
    otoplasty, the most common risks are poor healing, infection,
    bleeding, pain, unfavorable scarring, and blood clots. Some
    patients may experience a change in skin sensation, swelling,
    or discoloration of the skin. Cosmetic risks include asymmetry
    but patients can lower this risk by selecting a qualified
    surgeon with a proven record of success performing these types
    of procedures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Otoplasty is effective for improving or correcting the
    proportion, position, or shape of the ears. Trained plastic
    surgeons can use various techniques to correct birth defects
    or repair injuries that damage the ears. By restoring or
    creating a natural shape, surgeons can balance the face and
    ears improving appearance and boosting a patient&#8217;s
    self-esteem. Following the doctor&#8217;s orders after surgery
    increases the chances of experiencing a favorable outcome.

      >General Information Regarding Facial Cosmetic
      Surgery</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many people, young and old, who are unhappy with
    their physical appearance. Looks are important for a lot of
    people and advances in medicine and technology have made it
    possible for people to change their appearance to match their
    desires. Cosmetic surgery is a general term that is used to
    describe numerous non-surgical and surgical procedures carried
    out to reshape the body or face. These procedures are often
    done to improve attractiveness and boost self-esteem. Facial
    cosmetic surgery refers to that which is done specifically on
    the face. There are many procedures that are classified under
    this terminology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideal candidates for this procedure are those who are
    realistic when it comes to their expectations. They also have
    a positive outlook and are in good general health. Generally,
    plastic surgery is considered a personal choice. It should be
    done for an individual and not to satisfy the desires of
    another person. As most cosmetic procedures are elective, it
    is uncommon that they are covered by health insurance.

    >People are encouraged to do their research. These surgeries
    are invasive procedures that come with side effects and high
    risks. It is important that people understand the positives
    and negatives. They should consult with their surgeon before
    the procedure to go over their desired results, questions and
    concerns. It is essential that people work closely with
    qualified doctors. Top-quality surgeons are expected to
    provide better results and limit the risks to their patients.
    Still, there are potential dangers that can arise, including
    life-threatening complications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doctors will do an assessment with their patients in advanced
    to determine that they are fit for the procedure. This is also
    the time when they will share their plan and go over the
    details of the process, including how to prepare for the
    surgery, what will be done during the procedures and the
    post-operation details. It is important that patients follow
    instruction given by these professionals to ensure the best
    results and proper healing. Every person will respond
    differently to the process and have his or her own results.
  </p>
  <p>
    When looking for a surgeon to hire, there is a lot worth
    consideration. People should check to make sure they are
    properly educated and trained. They should be certified to
    perform this type of invasive procedure. Consider their
    reviews and ratings, available services, costs and payment
    options, portfolio of work, and similar details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most people have this work done in order to improve their
    appearance and boost confidence. However, there are some
    instances in which these surgeries are necessary. This is
    often referred to as reconstructive surgery and may be done on
    the face. The goal of these procedures is to fix deformities
    in order to make the face look as normal as possible. Often
    more than one procedure is necessary when working with
    patients who require face reconstruction. Surgeons involved in
    these patients might be also be tasked with improving
    functionality of certain facial parts in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Surgeries may be done on nearly every part of the face. Some
    of these are more complex than others. People may have work
    done on their nose, eyes, lips, forehead, chin, cheekbones,
    facial scars and skin of the face. Many people do this in
    order to make themselves look younger or better based on
    conventional ideals of what is physically attractive. These
    surgeries are done on both males and females. There are
    disadvantages and advantages to each one.
  </p>

    >Sometimes there is more than one approach to a procedure and
    the doctor will choose the best solution for each patient.
    Recovery time and results will differ by individual. Patients
    may be able to gain more insight into these things by speaking
    with their surgeon. It can also help to look at before and
    after photos of the work a surgeon has done. Technology today
    allows doctors to show patients images of what their after
    look may be following a surgery.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many online and offline resources available to those
    interested in these procedures. People should learn as much as
    they can about a procedure they are interested in having done.
    They should spend just as much time finding a qualified
    surgeon to perform the procedure. There are websites and
    databases online that provide information about surgeons
    available in a given area. Friends, family and acquaintances
    might also be able to offer recommendations or referrals. Keep
    in mind that some of these doctors specialize in a particular
    procedure or area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take the time to check into the background of a doctor. Make
    sure that he or she is board certified in facial plastic
    surgery. Consult with them in advance. This is a great
    opportunity to ask questions. Primary care doctors might also
    be able to recommend surgeons to their patients. In any case,
    always make sure to learn more about the experience, skills
    and training of the practicing surgeon. Botched surgeries can
    threaten health and wellness. These might also mean that more
    money must be spent on corrective surgeries.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a big decision to make. People need to be fully aware
    of what these procedures entail. They should take time to
    think about the decision before they commit to it. It is
    important that they are healthy enough to undergo an invasive
    procedure like surgery, which carries a lot of risks. Doctors
    will do an assessment to ensure they are physically fit, but
    it is also important that they are mentally prepared. The
    recovery process can be difficult for some, especially when
    healing on the face. This might mean they are away from their
    normal daily activities and life for some time. It is helpful
    if they have a strong system of support and are as mentally
    prepared as possible for all that might come after the
    surgery, whether it is good or bad. Many people find this to
    be successful and are pleased with their results.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good cosmetic surgery can improve self-confidence in a person
    and enhance their looks. Results, costs, recovery and other
    details will differ by situation. Patients are encouraged to
    be informed about the procedure and vocal with their surgeon
    when it comes to their needs, desires and concerns.

      >Everything That Consumers Need To Know About Ear Plastic
      Surgery</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Some people have ears that stick too far out. One ear can be
    significantly bigger than the other or other cosmetic issues
    can exist. These can be congenital problems that people were
    born with or they may be the result of impact events or other
    injuries. Fortunately, it is possible to have the corrected
    through ear plastic surgery. This is commonly referred to as
    otoplasty and it can have a significant impact on how people
    feel about themselves and on their overall appearances.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a
      href="http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ear-plastic-surgery.jpg"
      ><img
        class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-115"
        src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160203184609im_/http://www.koreanplasticsurgery.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ear-plastic-surgery-263x300.jpg"
        alt="ear plastic surgery"
        width="263"
        height="300" /></a
    >If you have concerns about the way that your ears look,
    whether these concerns pertain to the shape, size or placement
    of your ears, you should consult with a trusted plastic
    surgeon. This professional can assess the severity and nature
    of your issue and can provide a number of feasible suggestions
    for correcting the problem. If surgery is recommended, your
    provider will take action to learn whether or not your are a
    suitable candidate. This will include the performance of a
    comprehensive health examination and a series of questions
    about your medical history. Your provider will want to make
    sure that you are in good general health and that you do not
    suffer from any bleeding problems that negatively impact your
    clotting abilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important aspect of this process is making sure that
    you do not have any lifestyle habits or other factors that
    will complicate the recovery process. For instance, smoking
    cigarettes can have a significant impact on your body&#8217;s
    own healing abilities. If you do smoke, your provider may
    suggest completing a cessation program before the performance
    of your surgery so that risks are minimized and healing is
    optimal. It is also important for patients to stop using
    products like aspirin and Ibuprofen several weeks before
    treatment. These are known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
    products or NSAIDs and they can create bleeding issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have to have feasible goals for these procedures. Your
    provider can help you obtain a natural and balanced look for
    both ears so that there are no glaring or unappealing
    anomalies visible. Given that the corrective process will
    entail one or more incisions, there may be some scarring,
    however, your provider will work hard to ensure that no scars
    are visible. It is also important to have reasonable
    expectations for the healing process. Many people hope that
    they will simply rebound right after these efforts. They
    amount of time that it takes for you to recovery from these
    procedures will depend upon the natural of the issue that is
    being corrected and your overall surgical goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Patients should make sure that they are working with the right
    otoplasty surgeons for their needs. Some surgeons specialize
    in pediatric care and are therefore best for younger patients
    who have extreme cosmetic issues. Others have a large amount
    of experience in dealing with congenital defects. Working with
    a provider who is familiar with needs like your own will help
    you get the best possible results. For this and other reasons,
    it is best for people to spend a considerable amount of time
    on the screening process rather than simply hiring the first
    professionals that they stumble across.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good surgeon will have a strong commitment to continuing
    education. Providers who are willing to pursue post-doctorate
    training are able to stay abreast of all of the latest
    innovations in otoloplasty. As a result of this fact, they are
    often able to use the most innovative surgical tools and
    methods. Certain advancements have been introduced to limit
    the risks associated with these procedures and to make them
    far more effective. You can know more about a
    professional&#8217;s education and ongoing training by
    visiting his or her professional website.

        alt="ear plastic surgery cost"
        width="300"
        height="225" /></a
    >It is also a good idea to spend time considering some of the
    before and after images that have been posted in the
    provider&#8217;s gallery. You can look at these to see whether
    the surgeon uses sufficient artistry and skill for creating
    appealing results for all patients. You can also know more
    about the different physical challenges that these
    professionals have successfully overcome in the past.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a tour of a providers office before scheduling an
    appointment for one of these procedures. This gives you the
    opportunity to meet all members of the medical team and to get
    in-depth answers to any of the questions that you currently
    have. It is also a good time to learn more about the treatment
    environment and to see whether or not you are actually
    comfortable in this space. During your tour, you can also ask
    questions about the cost of these procedures and whether or
    not any portion of these charges will be covered by your
    insurance provider.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some instances in which insurance companies are
    willing to cover some or all of these costs. If corrective
    procedures are wholly cosmetic in nature, the resulting bills
    may be solely the responsibility of the patient. If they are
    related to congenital defects, however, or if they have a
    significant impact on the patient&#8217;s hearing, all related
    bills may be paid by the insurer. This is something that you
    can discuss with your provider during your consultation
    appointment or at the time of your office tour.
  </p>
  <p>
    A good provider will tell you everything that you need to know
    about proper before and aftercare for your procedure. This
    will give you the opportunity to plan ahead for any short-term
    lifestyle changes that need to be made in preparation of this
    event or to help expedite your recovery. You will probably
    need to spend a week or more in bed with your head elevated in
    order to prevent the build up of fluids at the surgical site
    and to alleviate pain and swelling. Some people find that it
    is best to take two to three weeks off of work or school in
    order to give themselves sufficient time to heal. Your
    procedure will be performed under general anesthesia and will
    be an outpatient event. Upon you discharge, you will likely be
    given antibiotics for preventing infection and pain pills for
    managing you discomfort throughout the formative and most
    challenging stages of the healing process.
